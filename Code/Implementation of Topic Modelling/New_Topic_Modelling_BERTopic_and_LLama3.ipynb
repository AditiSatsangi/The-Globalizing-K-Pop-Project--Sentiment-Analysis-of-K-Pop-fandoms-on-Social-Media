Also, every time I watch I'm reminded of how awful all the doctors are &amp; how all of them are horrible w\\u002f personal interactions #junho #2PM #RainorShine https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002fsz1m19MjUC @ErieP0P One of my favourites \\ud83e\\udd79\\ud83e\\udd70 @ErieP0P Still the best KDrama I\\u2018ve watched. It is amazing. #justbetweenlovers @ErieP0P It stands up so well to rewatches. Just so so good. @KimberlyHahnArt Yeah, I keep meaning to get some recommendations from my friend who has work by a lot of Dallas artists. For so long I just knew I wanted one but wasn't thinking too much about it since I didn't have the money. @ErieP0P Instagram is a great place to look for tattoo artists work and a lot of people travel to have tattoos done by a particular artist who has a signature style they want. Berlin for example: https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002f3aBXhPnN3S @ErieP0P But tattoo artists are artists in their own right, so they often are able to envision what your tattoo could be and propose it to you in their style. He just has his own 'cause he's an artist. He had a friend who was a tattoo artist in Dallas, hmm, wonder if he's still there. @ErieP0P It's good to start looking around for a tattoo artist and style you like. They can be so different &amp; sometimes they are booked up far out. My husband designs his own tattoos and has an amazing tattoo artist transfer\\u002farticulate his design. They talk about how to do it together. @KimberlyHahnArt Yeah, since I'm not a tattoo artist either I have no idea what they could do &amp; therefore what I'd want. Don't even know the style I'd want it in \\ud83e\\udd14 @ErieP0P \\ud83d\\udc4d Hey, no rush, it takes a long time to commit to forever. \\ud83d\\ude02 @KimberlyHahnArt Yep, definitely healing themes. I still haven't figured out where I want it either. So what size do I want. These things are why I've been mulling it over for like 3 yrs \\ud83d\\ude02 @ErieP0P I think something artistic could be rendered that shows rising from rubble, or like being reborn, finding connection. @KimberlyHahnArt Yeah, I definitely want to use some quotes, the translated ones. I'm iffy about putting it in Korean. Not only cause I can't read it, but I wouldn't know if it had been written correctly by the artist. Just gonna avoid all that worry \\ud83d\\ude02 @ErieP0P I get you, but I think something could be meaningfully constructed from aspects of the drama. Would it be meaningful to you, that is the most important part to capture. Remember, you can always use words or parts of phrases as well. @KimberlyHahnArt It's such a hard one because there really isn't a \\\"thing\\\". No reoccurring stuff animal, graphic, etc. Damn the slice of lifeness of it \\ud83d\\ude2d @ErieP0P Oh gosh, I'd have to rewatch to suggest something. If I do, I'll give it a thought. :) @KimberlyHahnArt It's so good!

My dad took me to see the movie Interstellar. I remember feeling amazed by the visuals and the concept of something so massive existing in space.\\n- Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape. They're formed when a massive star collapses in on itself and its gravity becomes so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime around it.\\n- The event horizon marks the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of a black hole. Once something crosses the event horizon, it's trapped forever.\\n- Scientists have observed several types of black holes, including stellar-mass black holes, supermassive black holes, and intermediate-mass black holes.\\n- Supermassive black holes reside at the centers of galaxies and can have masses millions or even billions of times that of the sun.\\n- The study of black holes has led to significant advances in our understanding of the universe, from the behavior of matter under extreme conditions to the properties of spacetime itself.\\n- Researchers continue to explore the mysteries of black holes using observations, simulations, and theoretical models.\\n\\n\\nThe topic is described by the following keywords: 'black, hole, space, gravity, star, collapse, event, horizon, scientists, study, universe, spacetime, mass, galaxy, research'.\\n\\nBased on the information about the topic above, please create a short label of this topic.

HELP ME @kebinwooo 😭 Me 2. ~13 yrs and only could recognize Xander.😭 @christo52325612 i think eli is in korea tho? i heard hes opening up a restaurant tho. no idea what kevin being from danville has to do with this but yeah hes in new york so no idea if he\\'ll be there at all :// @kebinwooo same girl same. i thought i\\'ve been a kissme long enough but can\\'t say for sure who is who 😂 @kebinwooo @yoycecamacho Well think of the members who stayed with the group cause Eli is here in California and Kevin woo lives in New York but he\\'s from Danville California @kebinwooo I thought Eli has a bit long face, which third one doesn\\'t seem to have. But let\\'s see 😉 @kebinwooo Probably because of my UKISS obsession...I\\'ve been stalking the post and tags the whole day 😂\\nI can see them sitting at home, looking at the guesses and laughing 😂😂😂 I hope they\\'ll tell us soon, the suspense is killing me 🙈 @Mitsubachiii omg i\\'m on people\\'s for you pages??? but yeah the fact that every single kissme has a different guess is WILD only ukiss i tell you 😂😂 @kebinwooo I\\'m sorr for coming in from the side (this was on my for you page) but THIS SPEAKS FROM MY HEART! I\\'ve followed them forever and can\\'t recognize even ONE of their shadows for sure?!! All the guesses make me more and more unsure of what I thought I saw first 😂😂😂 @KatieReamy the fact that the second photo looks like soohyun almost has me convinced of this too 😂😂😂 @kebinwooo My daughter says that the other silhouettes are just Soohyun Kiseop and Hoon just facing the opposite direction 🤣🤣🤣 @ValeriyaI3 not how i think the third one is eli 🧍\\u200d♀️ @kebinwooo im so bad and it\\'s hilarious honestly @kebinwooo 😂 lol I feel you. I thought I\\'d recognize them after being Kissme for 10 years, but no XD at least I got into them after Xander and Kibum, so there\\'s that. At least I\\'m sure there\\'s no Eli. @kebinwooo I FEEL TGE SAME. I am think  that the three are Xander, DongHo and Kevin, but i am NOT Sure and it is killing me hahaha @kebinwooo This is mE @param_opseo the way i opened the pictures and genuinely thought \"whoa are they ADDING three new members to ukiss???\" bc i cant even recognize any of them 😭 @kebinwooo same', \"Thinking that Kflex being postponed is not actually the worst for me because this way I might be able to plan things well and get a tattoo with the Frankfurt based artist I really love that same weekend @GosiauxKimmy Omg SO PRETTY!!! This is the one I got with Suya last year. I'm still brainstorming a couple of ideas for the new one 😂 https://t.co/onCZQDMqKD @2seung_ya Please share your design when you get  it done because suyas work is just *cheffs kiss* 😗👌 https://t.co/ODOJun8WgX @GosiauxKimmy her work is truly amazing! and ahh you're going to Korea! that's even more exciting 🥺 But yeah, if I'm going to go to another country to get a tattoo (not that I'm complaining 😂)  I  might as well make the most of it @kookfie_ 100% agree. At this point, they either have an amazing lineup and have everything go perfectly the day of the festival or they are over. They can't just push things back with the excuse that they offer refunds when people have already bought plane tickets, booked hotels etc @2seung_ya I got 2! By nos and getting a 3rd in korea in her studio. Support nos\\U0001faf6 \\nBut honestly just so it like you said, you are there anyway 👀 @GosiauxKimmy I might just go ahead and do it cause if I'm going to Frankfurt it's like killing two births with one stone, but I need to save up first 😂 and OMG YOU GOT A TATTOO BY NOS!! the line work is absolutely amazing @2seung_ya Omg yes suya is also a big fat yes. \\nNot jut she guests in brussels sometimes and I met her there when I got tattood by nos kim 🤭 @2seung_ya tbh kflex is kinda making fools of themselves atp like more and more people really don’t wanna go anymore and if it keeps going like this I feel like they will need a wonder and a really crazy comeback to ever survive atp till the october dates 😭😭😭 @GosiauxKimmy No, it's an artist called Suya. But I've been following Bora for a while and the painting strip tattoos she does are so pretty, can't say I'm not tempted 👀 did you get tattooed by her? @2seung_ya is it bora because if it's bora do it Thoughts are being thought\", 'I love #justbetweenlovers so much!

It is amazing. #justbetweenlovers @ErieP0P It stands up so well to rewatches. Just so so good. @KimberlyHahnArt Yeah, I keep meaning to get some recommendations from my friend who has work by a lot of Dallas artists. For so long I just knew I wanted one but wasn\\'t thinking too much about it since I didn\\'t have the money. @ErieP0P Instagram is a great place to look for tattoo artists work and a lot of people travel to have tattoos done by a particular artist who has a signature style they want. Berlin for example: https://t.co/3aBXhPnN3S @ErieP0P But tattoo artists are artists in their own right, so they often are able to envision what your tattoo could be and propose it to you in their style. He just has his own \\'cause he\\'s an artist. He had a friend who was a tattoo artist in Dallas, hmm, wonder if he\\'s still there. @ErieP0P It\\'s good to start looking around for a tattoo artist and style you like. They can be so different &amp; sometimes they are booked up far out. My husband designs his own tattoos and has an amazing tattoo artist transfer/articulate his design. They talk about how to do it together. @KimberlyHahnArt Yeah, since I\\'m not a tattoo artist either I have no idea what they could do &amp; therefore what I\\'d want. Don\\'t even know the style I\\'d want it in 🤔 @ErieP0P 👍 Hey, no rush, it takes a long time to commit to forever. 😂 @KimberlyHahnArt Yep, definitely healing themes. I still haven\\'t figured out where I want it either. So what size do I want. These things are why I\\'ve been mulling it over for like 3 yrs 😂 @ErieP0P I think something artistic could be rendered that shows rising from rubble, or like being reborn, finding connection. @KimberlyHahnArt Yeah, I definitely want to use some quotes, the translated ones. I\\'m iffy about putting it in Korean. Not only cause I can\\'t read it, but I wouldn\\'t know if it had been written correctly by the artist. Just gonna avoid all that worry 😂 @ErieP0P I get you, but I think something could be meaningfully constructed from aspects of the drama. Would it be meaningful to you, that is the most important part to capture. Remember, you can always use words or parts of phrases as well. @KimberlyHahnArt It\\'s such a hard one because there really isn\\'t a \"thing\". No reoccurring stuff animal, graphic, etc. Damn the slice of lifeness of it 😭 @ErieP0P Oh gosh, I\\'d have to rewatch to suggest something. If I do, I\\'ll give it a thought. :) @KimberlyHahnArt It\\'s so good! Still trying to figure out a tattoo based on it, but damn it\\'s hard 😭 @ErieP0P Always a good choice.🖤']\n",

And I think most of us feel this way, we're adults right? We have our own lifes to live too just like them @pumseongs I thought I was the only one who felt this way😭 thank you! i love sf9 a lot and I love the fandom too. And people talking abou their personal lives and this being a safe space for us does make it better, doesn't it? @pumseongs you're my kind of Fantasy. 🥰 @pumseongs they can go cry baby 😛 just share whatever you want ❤️❤️❤️❤️\", \"Sure sometimes I'll have the tastebuds of a child but I sleep well knowing I don't hate mushrooms like some baby @instinctangel i love u more liam ☝🏻 @abcixer Still love you tho 💙💙 @abcixer Well you're a child so of course that's your opinion 🤗 @instinctangel mushrooms suck @Yeo_Cry_Tea Imma always fuck up some mushrooms 😫 @instinctangel MUSHROOMS 🔛🔝 @love4chani RIGHT RIGHT YEOP 😁 @instinctangel i’ll give u that…😒😒 @love4chani I cook better than you so ion knowwwww @instinctangel not taking anything seriously from liam the food terroriser here @love4chani You're the one that doesn't eat mushrooms AND tomatoes like its weird.. @instinctangel i am not the one who needs to seek help here https://t.co/w2OS96PPsf @love4chani Seek help and maturity 💙💙 @instinctangel and ill happily accept being OLD and ODD. i wont be putting them vegetables voluntarily near my mouth @love4chani But also old never mind 🤔 @love4chani You're old...

They had a soft opening on Friday, so their stock is limited, but they have plans for K-beauty, snacks, and a space for events and pc trading too! It’s a super cute shop, and the owners and workers are really nice! @krklemm Oh no.... When does this open? Sounds a lil too tempting 😭 @ilyiknxw I talked to one of the owners who said they’re planning to partner with some of the cupsleeve event people to have events at the store, so maybe you can make a day out of it at some point! @krklemm @thekpopempire Me being glad I live nowhere near but also intensely sad about it @krklemm Nice! @Dreamsaboutkpop Yes, true! I got a Yuna and Yeji duo pc when I bought It’z Me, so I do have her fave somewhere! lol @krklemm The photo strip is so cool! I love it! \\nIt’s a shame but Atleast you were lucky with your pulls and you maybe be able to find Yuna somewhere else @Dreamsaboutkpop I love the photo strip and whatever you want to call the clear thingy with Ryujin’s pic! I am bummed for no Yuna, because then I’d have all 5 members, but these inclusions are so cute! @krklemm Omg I love that! Not bad, not bad! I’m a little sad that there’s no Yuna, since I got everyone else, but what fun extas and pretty pcs! https://t.co/U0o5qTA83n @MrobinS19 Ooh really? I’ve been debating getting it, and I finally caved! @krklemm @thekpopempire I’m gonna say Lia but that’s cause she’s my bias @krklemm @thekpopempire I literally just listened to Cheshire', 'Kong has my whole heart...but can someone pls tell me why it is ₩42.000 whereas Jaeng and Lil\\'ssong-ssong were ₩18.000?

So no bear key ring no one will get it? @_montasy_ @mochiemobts Someone posted the refund mail. There it says production issues.\\nWhatever it is, there will be no keyring rn. @madame_tourvel @mochiemobts maybe you all will be able to order it after some  design changes 🤞 @_montasy_ @mochiemobts Yeah. I would have only ordered for that. @madame_tourvel @mochiemobts too bad 😔 and literally everybody wanted that keychain @_montasy_ @mochiemobts I saw someone wrote they cancelled it because of similarities to an existing product. It isn\\'t in the store anymore. @madame_tourvel @mochiemobts oh 😯 but why? Are there any problems with production? That\\'s a pity, Yootae really put all his effort in the little guy @_montasy_ @mochiemobts \"Problem\" solved for the moment.  No keyring no money spent by me rn.\\nI\\'m only sad for Tae. @mochiemobts @madame_tourvel that\\'s optimistic me speaking 😎 we will ask her in a few weeks if she still thinks this way 😆 @MindofStacey watch them giving Kong a whole story line like they did with Ssong-Ssong ☺️ that would be so cute...imagine the two and Jaeng going on little adventures 🤩 @_montasy_ @madame_tourvel Good thinking 😅 @_montasy_ Especially since ☀️ is saying so much about the details. @mochiemobts @madame_tourvel nope 😅 I have hopes for a tour next year and tbh I am tempted to go to several stops so my wallet is in custody for the moment @mochiemobts @madame_tourvel hope they put the extra money into the guys\\' next comeback/photobook whatever 😤 @_montasy_ @madame_tourvel Are you still buying it bets? 😅 @_montasy_ @mochiemobts For us it\\'s 64 Dollars for the photobook and doll. @mochiemobts @_montasy_ @madame_tourvel They priced it so high knowing very well that the bear is Yootae’s symbol and the ONE item that everyone would want.  No other way to see it. @_montasy_ @madame_tourvel Yes.. the inseong doll that was the same size cost 18 won and the bear cost 42 won how is that okay? @mochiemobts @madame_tourvel wait what?? plus costums is always around 40€...that\\'s ridiculous @_montasy_ @madame_tourvel 58 dollars in shipping for the bear and photo book alone @madame_tourvel @mochiemobts how much exactly?? @_montasy_ @mochiemobts I did look. It\\'s not a nice thing to look at... @mochiemobts I am afraid to look tbh 😅 and to think about costums added on it...🙈 @MindofStacey give us something cute with button eyes and it\\'s a lost cause 😩 @_montasy_ Ahhh so cute @_montasy_ They are milking us for money and the shipping.. did you see it?? @_montasy_ Fan Meet pricing, they know we’ll buy it😫 @_montasy_ 🤣 I like it … a lock of hair 💇\\u200d♂️👏 @Lucy281028 Or a lock of his hair...🤔 that\\'s why he keeps it this long 😱😂 @_montasy_ hahah he should be for that price! @Lucy281028 who knows...maybe yootae is included in the order 😄 @_montasy_ I thought the price was high too 🤨 but I don’t know why.']\n"
