sf9,Baby Fantasy Guide,"I checked the pinned post in this sub, and turns out it's not updated (it's only up to RPM era) and OP is most probably inactive.

I found [https://fantasy9.carrd.co/](https://fantasy9.carrd.co/) recently, and it seems to have the most recent and updated guide to SF9, which as a baby Fantasy, can be a lot of help (since the contents that we already have can be a bit overwhelming).

If you have seen other resources that provide a more organized and complete content or is not included in the carrd linked above, please comment here, so that new Fantasys can have an easier time!

mernda1: His back issue plays a big role in leaving the group and his drama choices

OwlRepresentative77: He has been picking projects that are on the fantasy side for the most part as I think he likes doing them and I am so glad he does. Even if you don't like historical stuff you have to admit he looks good in the robes!

vip_insomnia: I would say while yes his acting career taking off played a big factor also so did his back. But it was also FNC scheduling him for all this acting that really didn‚Äôt let his back heal well. He does fantasy/historical dramas well so must like doing them.

Dazzling-Progress-11: This hurts still.

Kpop-Multi-stan: I don't think it was that he was done with them, but more of a health decision. His back has been getting worse over the years, and even though he doesn't mention it, I'm sure it causes him a lot of pain. Even in the Puzzle comeback, he was very stiff, compared to Trauma, where he DID dance, and wasn't quite as stiff. On the other hand, he said that his life is taking another direction, as he's getting cast in more and more roles, so I think it was a decision of practicality altogether. I mean...I AM very biased, since he's my bias lol, and I'll miss him in the group a lot.",emotional

------
SatisfactionGloomy54: this is really heartbreaking. i know he doesnt want to leave sf9. i can see how happy he is everytime they are complete and perform together. after all, i still understand his decision. he also had back problems/injuries in the past that may also became one of the main reasons why he left. im glad that he's still under FNC so sf9 and him may still cross paths.

FeeCurious: Damn, this really hurts. I love literally every drama that Rowoon has been in (particularly Extraordinary You, it's my favourite of all time, and it breaks my heart), but I am so upset knowing that his voice will be missing from SF9. He is my bias because his vocals truly take my breath away. I wish him the best in absolutely everything, and I know this decision was very hard for him, but my heart is certainly heavy. I hope his isn't so heavy that he feels any uncertainty or guilt. Good luck to him in accomplishing all of his dreams, and everyone who follows him, let's support him wholeheartedly purple_heart

------
Gold_Veterinarian_75: The part where he apologizes for being too sensitive and not clearing up misunderstandings made me really sad. That was never his job, and I hate to see someone apologize for the way their heart is. But all in all, I appreciate how you can tell that it's a letter that he truly wrote, not some publicist. It's full of honesty and gratefulness, and you can't ask anything else of someone. PS: Also, I think it's totally understandable that someone who got started in a field at 15/14 feels the urge to take stock and make changes at 27 lol
------
yoonchwita: Rowoon's presence will definitely be missed, but I think everyone saw this coming. He'll always be a part of the fantasy though, and maybe we'll see him back one day.
------
Kpop-Multi-stan: Rowoon is one of my ult biases, so it hurts that he left the group, but I can see that it was a practical decision that he had to make. He has acting roles that often prevent him from performing, as well as other schedules. On top of that, he lives with back pain, so I'm sure dancing is a struggle and it's getting worse as he is nearing his 30s. I know that he does care about his group, and also the fans, so that's not a factor here. I wish him all the best, and will continue to watch his dramas, as well as be as big of a Fantasy as I have always been.

I don't know if this is quoted from one of Dawon's recent live but here is something that someone wrote (i guess as a transcript from a live) and I am trying to figure out the context. 
""I don't know why you're asking me to do this
When I asked to change my prom name, I changed it right away.
I do everything you ask me to do
It is complete only when you see him shake his head at the end.

tlrnsibesnick: Article Context: SF9‚Äôs Rowoon might be coming to us in a new historical drama! On January 19, an industry representative reported that Rowoon will be starring in the upcoming drama ‚ÄúSending Me to You.‚Äù Rowoon‚Äôs agency FNC Entertainment clarified regarding the report, ‚Äú‚ÄòSending Me to You‚Äô (literal title) is one of the casting offers he has received.‚Äù ‚ÄúSending Me to You‚Äù is a comedic romance set during the Joseon dynasty. It tells the story of the meeting between the young widow Jung Soon Deok and young widower Shim Jung Woo as well as the struggle the two go through together to marry off the four young maidens who represent Joseon. Rowoon received an offer to play the role of Shim Jung Woo. Shim Jung Woo has a brilliant mind and such natural good looks that others can‚Äôt help but look over their shoulder when they pass by. He couldn‚Äôt stay out of the spotlight as when he turned 17, the princess fell for him, and he became the son-in-law of the king. However, the the princess collapsed during their wedding ceremony, leaving Shim Jung Woo a widower and the king‚Äôs son-in-law at the age of 17. He asks for their marriage to be invalidated and requests his talents simply be used to help his country. This all leads to him entering the matchmaking business, working to marry off the young maidens in the country under the king‚Äôs orders. ‚ÄúSending Me to You‚Äù may be Rowoon‚Äôs next historical drama after starring in the hit series ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Affection,‚Äù creating much anticipation. Rowoon is also currently gearing up for his upcoming drama ‚ÄúDestined with You‚Äù with Jo Bo Ah. Stay tuned for more updates!

sf9,Sf9 fan call,Hi everyone! I joined an Sf9 album group order and a fan call was up to win and it seems I won!! I was told I can pick which member I can talk to and I‚Äôm planning to talk to Zuho. I never did a kpop fan call and I‚Äôm just wondering how does it work? Do y‚Äôall have experiences or advice? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com/r/SF9/comments/106qhth/sf9_fan_call/,"kingdomcoba: Never had a fancall before but all I will say is have fun!! Had a few small interactions with Zuho from second row of their concert in Chicago recently, and if anything my impression of him is that he *really* enjoys music/ writing and being an artist. He is super sweet and attentive to fans as well; one of the most fan-interactive idols I‚Äôve ever seen. Hope you have a good experience!!
------
Idkwhyiamhere11: I have no idea but I'm so happy for you! Have a great time loudly_crying_facered_heart
------
basta_cosi: Oooh, Zuho! Waiting for his kdrama to come out!
------
Deleted_User: Thank you so much!! I‚Äôm so happy it went well with Zuho. He seems truly amazing and I can‚Äôt wait for our time together pleading_face
------
basta_cosi: >most fan-interactive idols Right? He was so good leading in the NYC show!
------
Idkwhyiamhere11: Omg I'm so happy for you! How was your experiences with other members too?
------
kingdomcoba: Yes!! Especially during Paradise, he was making the most of his time and energy! I loveddd the black outfits you guys got for your show by the way!
------
kingdomcoba: It was so nice!!! I had a lott of little interactions/ moments with Jaeyoon, I wish I could post pictures and videos to show them as well as with other members!! Jaeyoon and Zuho loved our side of the stage and also I think separately appreciated how energetic I was (I‚Äôm usually *never* this close up at concerts so I didn‚Äôt fully realize how many front few row people silently film the whole thing, which is absolutely fine and their choice but I might‚Äôve been a bit too hyped rip). I‚Äôm used to going crazy dancing from the nosebleeds so it was definitely a different experience up close. Taeyang- seemed super happy to perform and was really in his element. So many dance breaks it was insane!! Really made sure to pay attention to every fan he could. I made sure to hype up his dances every time!! He‚Äôs a super special artist to me and has been for a long time so all of our little moments were precious. Showed my mom my video of the hi wave where he looked back and said thank you and she said that he‚Äôs pretty (he really is, such a genuine smile). Very careful and attentive to his work while performing but so carefree and happy when just singing/ interacting. Dawon- super funny, seemed a bit tired but still put so much effort which was much appreciated knowing how it is to be tired and have to move around. Saw me nearly sobbing during easy love and was slightly judging/ laughed *lol*, especially since roar was right ! directly after and it switched from tears to ‚Äúhey, little mama.‚Äù Really helped carry lots of parts of missing members. My sister says he like a human Ken doll, she‚Äôs not wrong!! Has some of the best skin ever haha. Hwiyoung- he was really vibing and enjoying watching the members/ fans, but when it was his moment to shine, he *really* excelled/ shone in every way. Didn‚Äôt realize how many times he looked over and I didn‚Äôt notice until looking over my videos, so sad. He and ty have always had a special place in my heart. Made it up ?? I think with this cute little [wave](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRgMnnox/) at the goodbye and a small lil head bow at the hi wave. Zuho- already explained how great he is!! But wanted to share that I gave a thumbs up at the end of sound check and he gave a thumbs up, ok sign and nod back; he really notices so much! Also, the girl next to my sister had a sign that said ‚ÄúZuho best Venus,‚Äù and when he sung that line during performing he moved away from the formation a bit and pointed directly to her! She was so happy, it was so sweet. He seemed so comfortable and at home with fantasys. Chani- seemed a bit shy which was expected, as well as a bit tired too which is totally okay! My sister had a huge headache unfortunately and stood still for lots of the concert, and he seemed to surprisingly check up on her somewhat/ notice her quite a bit ?? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because they have similar energy haha but it was very nice. When he had his dancing moments they were awesome! I was so obsessed with Valhalla, and his voice live sounds so similar to the songs. He made sure to look/ wave at the fans higher up too! Jaeyoon- again, so many little moments I won‚Äôt even begin to share because this comment would be so long for you to read haha, but he was fantastic! Like Dawon, he really really carried the lines of missing members. Of course, he also seemed to take on a portion of the leader role with Youngbin gone. He was acting cute a lot of the time, but also has a charm where it was exuded naturally. He also seemed so happy to be with fans/ people hyping him up pfft. He honestly seemed to thrive off the energy and I didn‚Äôt quite realize just how much of an underrated dancer/ performer he really is! I can go into more detail about any of the members or share any moments with them if you like! I made sure to make the most of my opportunity and give them lots of support for all of the fantasys who couldn‚Äôt go, I know how it feels [] ( all of them really appreciated any thumbs up and claps they saw!Again, I wish I could post little clips and screenshots agh. Sorry for the long comment but hope you enjoy!
------
Idkwhyiamhere11: Omg tysm for telling me in such details<3 I'm so happy for your fullest enjoyment in concert and I'm kinda jealous tho:) Hwi is my bias and I would've passed out if he would look at me and wave like that omg thank you for the vid too I want to hear more about Hwi. The way you interacted with them were literally so sweet and heartwarming! You can go for more details if you're okay and have free time and I'm ready to listen ofc<3. Like you said, ut looks like Jaeyoon takes the leader role when Binnie isn't around. He looks so sweet and cute and he's always smiling the whole damn time. I heard that Taeyang body proportions and height were literally on another level and the way he danced was the perfection from other fantasies. And zuho is the most interactive one with fans for sure he has the most attractive charm and he looks so happy with fans I love him sm too. As expected, Dawon must be the funniest one watching their concerts haha he's so energetic and funny. And Chani his voice is so deep right? He's my third bias and I want to hear more about him too he's so cute. I hope to see Rowoon,Bin and Inseong too<3 Again,thank you for sharing your experiences with them. I hope to see them one day too<3.

sf9,sf9 problematic??,"so i‚Äôve been listening to sf9 for a long time, but this comeback made me want to stan. However then i saw a lot of people say they were problematic and googled it, however a lot of things on there seemed to be just made up by anti‚Äôs, can anyone tell me what sf9 has actually done? Thank youuu!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SF9/comments/1077hpu/sf9_problematic/,"Idkwhyiamhere11: No. Only two things were Dawon's hair in Mamma Mia and Hwiyoung,Chani party scandal in pandemic. Dawon was uneducated and already apologized for it. So do Hwiyoung and Chani too. Also some people spread rumors that Hwi and Chani were going to illegal bars (prostitution and drugs) to celebrate Chani's birthday. It was also not true and sf9 officially cleared it too. If you're talking about the twitter things (rowoon N word and Zuho taking the fan back to his studio things), they're also not real and just rumors spread by haters. Sf9 is one of the most well-mannered,polite and talented groups and I'll say it again and again, they deserve more success for real.
------
mooonbeans: I feel like those ""issues"" came from the same people that said that Dawon's first aid response was a PR stunt from FNC for this CB face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy. If they had any issues, they've already addressed it and apologized for it (HwiChan). Please don't let those ""problematic"" issues keep you from discovering SF9's music and charms.
------
Salty-Enthusiasm-939: As far as I know, the only thing was Dawon's hairstyle in the Mamma Mia MV.
------
halcyon_summer: When you say ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù, what do you mean by that? Are you referring to racism, bullying and such? I always heard this thrown around to a lot of groups but I am still lost. Sorry, I am not very much up to date to new kpop terminologies anymore lol. As far as I know, much of their issues and allegations were cleared. Most of them are mostly unfounded rumors or baseless allegations. If you are referring to proven issues, then the only one I can think of is the breaking of covid rules by the maknaes. There were published articles on that. If I am not mistaken, the maknaes were caught by the authorities celebrating Chani‚Äôs birthday past the curfew. However, some people spread rumors on forums that they were celebrating in an illegal place (pr*stitution was implied), but in the published reports say it was in a hold‚Äôem pub (which is a legal place). Later on, the case was dismissed by the prosecution. If you are referring pre-pandemic issues, maybe some older fantasies can answer your question. I don‚Äôt dig things like that lol.
------
channgro: nah and idc
------
hwangyuras: The only things are DW's styling in Mamma Mia, the maknaes being caught out after curfew in a hold 'em pub at a time right after there had been an outbreak in similar venues (which they apologized for, and things were cleared), the maknaes being in KC0N's stereotypical skit because the whole concept for that KC0N was Mexico (but people act as if they wrote the skit themselves) face_exhaling, and YB being careless about his comments re:getting vaccinated during a vlive (he was weighing on whether he should get it because he was worried about the days it would take to recover, and was like ""ehhhh I'm not going to get it"", but at the end of the live said he would try to book an appointment again„Ö° someone cut the second part so it only shows him saying that he might not get sick. He apologized and cleared things that same night though, and got vaccinated a couple of days after). The rest unfortunately, were part of a so-called exposing thread posted after Kingdom and were mostly a lot of false tweets and vlives cut to take stuff out of context and present them weirdly. It went viral among bigger fandoms on twt while the group was promoting Teardrop, and reached their actual fans last. While their fans posted clarifications and the original clips, people usually just stick around for scandal and stick with that narrative. It doesn't help that there are some dedicated accounts on twt who like to throw these accusations out randomly, and who have most of fantasy twt blocked so they won't be called out.

Idkwhyiamhere11: No problem! Welcome to the club haha<3

Salty-Enthusiasm-939: I've not heard about that, but then I try to avoid Twitter grinning_squinting_face
------
halcyon_summer: I‚Äôm not a korean but I am pretty much sure that it was ‚ÄúÎÇ¥ Í∞Ä‚Äù which sounds similar to the n-word.
------
hwangyuras: Ultimately it's up to you if you want to stan them or not haha. They've had their own share of mistakes (as do a lot of groups), but their inaccessibility to a more global audience due to how their company manages them, a company that ignores anyone outside their Korean fandom, plus increased scrutiny on their mistakes after Kingdom sometimes does affect their reputation among global fan circles. I'm just glad their KR fanbase is dedicated and there are fans still willing to check them out.
------
Formal_Importance534: haha fair enough thanks!
------
Formal_Importance534: see that‚Äôs what i thought, but people were saying koreans said that it wouldn‚Äôt make sense confused_face
------
halcyon_summer: If you look into the context of the issue, it would not make sense to randomly throw that word around in a korean conversation (unless, they use english as one of their native tongues). If it was raised by an international kpop fan, i think was pretty much a case of misunderstanding and just some words lost in translation.

unitaya: If you're already familiar with their music, then I recommend [SF9 Center](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCnuQTGyjuY0gZfbunp6TVJ8hXtMWWlN2)! It's a variety show on YouTube and not all of the members feature in each episode (in fact, Dawon and Rowoon are only in 1) but because each episode is shorter and maybe only 5 members are in an episode tops, you can easily pick up the member's personalities:)

So I know it says check-in starts at 3:30pm but it also says admission for soundcheck will be held at 4:30pm so does that mean I have from 3:30pm-4:30pm to check in? Also I‚Äôve heard that merch was only a shirt and a beanie so does vip get to shop for merch after soundcheck or can we shop for it after VIP check-in?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SF9/comments/zck6aw/questions_about_vip_checkin/,"vip_insomnia: yes check in is from 3:30-4:30 though i shee they did allow some check in after 4:30 but if you are too late you have to wait till after sound check. after you check in they line you back up as much as they can in order you were before and bring you in at 4:30 for sound check. you stand in lines a lot lol.
------
Away-Gap3192: Thank you! I also have another question, for sound check do we just sit in the seats we bought or is it like first come first serve in line? I‚Äôm guessing I gotta zoom after soundcheck to buy some merch face_with_tears_of_joy
------
vip_insomnia: first come first serve since vip was separated from your ticket. so people in the back can also have VIP too. basically when they line you up after yoir check in they want you to try to stay in the order you were before you checked in‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt always work since they arent doing numbered bands its bands for the different tiers of VIP. so at 4:30 they bring you in and line you up in order then bring you into the seats they want you to sit in. then after sound check when you can come back into the seats when doors open for everyone you go to your ticketed seats. they scan your tickets when you come in for sound check cause you stay inside the whole time but no you sit based on how early you got there and how the staff lines you up for sound check. im not sure how it will work for the standing venue but thats how NY and Chicago worked. also merch yes its just a hat and shirts but i think it was sold out? not sure i bought before online so didnt go to merch table.

As mochie-gray said, the VIP is purchased separate from the tickets so you have to buy the GA ticket separately. The VIP had 3 levels and the top levels sold out immediately. I think you would have trouble getting the benefits transferred now because they have time limits for that. Unless maybe you meet with the seller at the concert and they take you in with them.

Deleted_User: I don‚Äôt know if anyone selling VIP tickets like for the hi-touch and everything, but I don‚Äôt think the tickets are different for the pit and regular GA, unless that‚Äôs the difference between the 80$/95$ option when you buy tickets.

Mumble_1230: It was my first SF9 / kpop concert so everything was super new to me. The high wave and group picture both were pretty rushed. But I've heard NY was even more rushed for the high wave. For group pictures, people with passes had a number written on their hand (1-10) and was seated according to the number we were marked with. Pictures were in groups of 10. 6-10 in front, 1-5 in row behind, then SF9 last. We weren't allow to talk to the members, were told to sit down, take picture, then escorted out.

sf9,Friendly reminder that the LA show still has plenty of floor tickets on Live Nation.,"There are still many unsold tickets on the floor and in the mezz. Please consider buying from Live Nation first, as they are the official seller so the ticket will be in your name and you'll run no chance of being scammed.

Deleted_User: Ah I want to swing going to their concert so bad. Does anyone know the difference between the two floor tickets? One is listed at 80$ and one is listed at 90$?
------
nubbit09: I wish I could go to multiple shows I had so much fun at the NY one I miss them already loudly_crying_face
------
expensive_girl: I do too! I'm so sad they aren't selling well because I'm scared they won't come back if this experience isn't worth it moneywise. And there's that festival that day so I'm not sure as many last-minute tickets will be sold as would be for other events. Ugh! sad_but_relieved_face
------
expensive_girl: My guess would be that maybe the $90 tickets are the first tier closest to the stage and the $80 ones are further from the stage, but others say there's no difference. Like maybe how some festivals randomly sell cheaper tickets earlier and leave them there until they sell out even once the higher priced tickets are released? I would assume the people that say there's no difference know what they're talking about because they've attended GA standing shows at the Wiltern, but I personally would take the more expensive ones just in case. But you'll notice the $80 and $90 are both in the middle of the map, they aren't separated in any way, so whichever choice you make I hope you'll update after the show.
------
expensive_girl: Kind Fantasys went live on Tiktok during the Chicago and Dallas shows. Maybe if you're free you could search at 7:30 tonight Denver, CO time in case someone does a live for tonight's show? Then you can see SF9 again and help promote them growing_heart.
------
Mumble_1230: Thanks! I was actually wondering the same thing on if there was a difference too. I wanted to go so bad loudly_crying_face but I'm afraid of being pushed (most likely to the side or back)
------
expensive_girl: Same problem here! My friend I'm going with is high risk for COVID, so we can't take the chance of being smooshed together like sardines with a bunch of strangers. I really wish the floor was seated to make it safer for everyone. Even if the floor was tiered but standing, if we knew for sure what the setup was like we would have possibly been able to go broken_heart. I hope you'll consider checking Live Nation before the show? Loge section is supposed to be a great and non-crowded view, especially in the first couple rows. Maybe some surprise tickets will pop up there the day of the show? Or maybe scalper prices will drop on Stubhub?",emotional

Accomplished_Dare490: I am shocked!! Us Int'l fans have never seen it performed live (b/c it came out during COVID and they couldn't tour) - Here's me hoping they ""mix it up"" with the setlist for the Chicago date! hahahaha By the way, this is my ULTIMATE FAVORITE SONG by them...(sigh)

kfpdreamie: Yeah and it looks like jungle games and shine together aren't being performed either loudly_crying_face I'm still so excited though

bbbambbi: It‚Äôs my favorite song, too!!! It‚Äôs the song that introduced me to them! I was so sad it wasn‚Äôt included in the Seoul setlist, but thought maybe the US would get a little treat! If other dates get Good Guy‚Ä¶ I will riot LOL
------
bbbambbi: It was all so good! I wonder if they‚Äôll be cycling through solos? Hope so! So sad we missed a Jaeyoon solo!

sf9,NYC HI-TOUCH,"I did NOT think the guys would be up so close to us during this - took me way off guard (in a good way)! Though, I do think the hi-touch experience would have been so much better if staff/security weren‚Äôt BARKING right into our ears the entire 15 seconds - ‚ÄúHURRY UP LADIES‚Äù ‚ÄúKEEP IT MOVING‚Äù ‚ÄúGO GO GO‚Äù! It was so distracting being yelled at such close proximity while also trying to make the most of the few seconds we had with the members!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SF9/comments/z9gd6i/nyc_hitouch/,"Steffy_love: Honestly, the entire experience besides getting to see SF9 themselves was disorganized and a complete mess. The vip check-in was horrible. After the show, it seemed like the staff had no idea what they were doing. The hi-wave was SO quick. We paid a good amount of money for this, but the staff ruined everything. No one ever needs to scream like they did yesterday.
------
unitaya: It was so disrespectful how they were trying to herd us around like animals as if it wasn't their own shortcomings as an clothing (!!! yeah they're a merch company first, not a tour organizer) company that caused all of the confusion. I spent $300 for 2 people's VVIP WONDER and you're telling me the hi wave was 12 seconds long? And yes, I checked my fancam and it was terrible and shaky and full of yelling. And then the photo was bad too!! 10 people so 2 rows of 5? Whats the benefit for the people in the first row??
------
nubbit09: I definitely felt like I was rushed by the staff even though I wasn‚Äôt even moving slowly! Also the person in front of me was filming with their phone and I felt like the guys all looked at it and I didn‚Äôt really get to make eye contact with anyone loudly_crying_face oh well, it was better than nothing!
------
vip_insomnia: a lot of these smaller tour companies that are working with smaller kpop groups are absolutely horrible at organizing. sometimes its also a mix of the venue staff not understanding some things. but yeah its truly unnecessary all the yelling. i kinda wish phones weren‚Äôt allowed because then all the members look at that person and the 1-2 people behind them get maybe one member that looks at them so it sucks when you have paid so much. my friend slightly slowed (not much) down cause a member said something back to her to hear and of course the yelling like we are at boot camp got louder.
------
Accomplished_Dare490: OHHH I can't wait for Chicago! For the hi touch, are you close enough where you can give them a gift? (like a stuffed animal)? I saw at Hallyu Fest in London, some people did that and I wanted to give a gift to Chani, but it sounds like the staff will yell at me if I did that! eeks! So happy you had a nice experience!
------
bbbambbi: The screaming was so uncalled for! As well at the out right rudeness from most of the staff during line ups and check in‚Ä¶ imo! I get it‚Äôs a stressful environment, but there was so need for half of what happened. Such a great performance from the guys - just a sucky feeling that it‚Äôs paired w the bad experience of the after concert events.
------
Accomplished_Dare490: Oh no! What happened at the VIP checkin? Any tips for us going to the remaining concerts?
------
bbbambbi: Completely agree! I felt like I was at a full blown football practice and coaches were yelling at me to hustle or something! It was ALLLL such a mess!
------
bbbambbi: Better than nothing? Yes. Worth the price of the VIP add-on? No! One staff member yelled so loudly into my ear it legitimately frightened me and I ended up looking over at him and once I realized what even happened I was already at the end of the line and had to exit! Sooooo poorly executed
------
bbbambbi: I was really surprised they allowed phones at all during the hi-wave! When they made the announcement that we could use them I was a little shook! We were literally all in bootcamp for 10 seconds!
------
unitaya: No, my friend offered Jaeyoon a letter but he really apologetically shook his head and crossed his hands
------
bbbambbi: It was just fairly disorganized - couldn‚Äôt tell what lines were for, no blatant signage, a bit of rudeness from staff. They will ask for your ID and payment confirmation e-mail from WW! Hoping it‚Äôs a bit better for the remaining dates!
------
Steffy_love: They kept us outside in the pouring rain for about more than an hour. Admission was supposed to be at 4:30pm for vvip, but we didn't enter until a little after 5:30pm. Once we got in, the lines were a complete mess! Then after the concert, none of the staff members knew where to put us. A mess.
------
Accomplished_Dare490: I wonder if it's the same ""crew"" in Chicago....I hope not....I don't want someone yelling at me! hahahaha
------
unitaya: right? like i didn't even know the members were in that hallway because there were so many people! and they were standing on a platform!! i really thought they were staff because they were sandwiched in between staff too T\_T

bbbambbi: I hope not, too! I really couldn‚Äôt tell if it was WW staff or venue staff/security. Praying they get it together for the remaining dates!
------
bbbambbi: I truly had no clue what was going on until I was right in front of them, too! I turned the corner and was like, ‚Äúoh shit!‚Äù
------
Mumble_1230: I went to the Chicago one and came back from the restroom, was last in line with a friend. I didn't know what was going on, I thought we were in line moving to a spot to prepare for high wave. But nope, I kept hearing ""keep moving keep moving."" I turned around and didn't see my friend so I stopped a bit, but the staff kept rushing me. Next thing I know, SF9 was 8-10 ft away, I didn't have my phone out to record (since I didn't know what was going on), people in front of me were already gone (cause I stopped to look for my friend at the beginning), and I'm literally by myself... Im pretty sure I looked like a deer caught in headlights. It also didn't helped that I had a mini panic attacked earlier (something fun I developed during the pandemic). The security saw me shriveled up and said ""don't be shy, you paid for this."" I honestly don't remember much aside seeing Zuho, Jaeyoon's hair, and Taeyang waving (cause he was last).

Wartonker: I reached out to Wonderwall and this is what they said >It will run for about an hour from 15:30.

nubbit09: OMG I was wondering this too, VIP check in is 3:30 for photo cards and admission to the sound check is 4:30 but sound check doesn‚Äôt start until 5:40, are they expecting check in to take an hour?? Are we supposed to hang around there from 3:30 until the end of sound check?

Accomplished_Dare490: This will be my first kpop concert - super excited and SF9 is just my dream group. Quick question for anyone with kpop concert experience: I'm going to the Chicago show. If I go at 3:30pm to check-in and get my ""stuff"" (picture cards, etc), can I just leave and come back for the concert? Or do they not allow people to ""go out/come back in""?
------
vip_insomnia: i mean its much less than other concerts but i think you dont have to show up right at 3:30 i think there is like an hour window. the twice check in was at 1pm and you had to stay inside the arena till soundcheck at 5 with like popcorn and hot dogs as your only options.

I'm thinking unit and solo promos, with most of them continuing to do dramas and musicals. The recent news about HSH being CEO again makes me hopeful though. FTIsland, CNBLUE and AOA were able to promote as groups before even if they had members who were more popular than their own groups.
------
juwaria91: I know this sounds really bad - but i would not be surprised if we get news that he has left the group. He's pretty successful on his own merit and it has become painfully obvious that his heart is not in it anymore. During the 6th Anniversary live did you see how slightly awkward it got when Chani mentioned that fans were asking after Rowoon and Yootae had to quickly say that he couldn't make it but his heart was there etc etc. I don't think we'll get an ot9 for a very very long time and by that time they'll all most likely go their own ways which makes me so freaking sad but it's better to rip the band aid off early tbh
------
vip_insomnia: i was also kinda waiting to see what their seasons greetings will be like this year like all 9‚Ä¶ something they did the photoshoot before enlistments or after because its just a photoshoot‚Ä¶ if he doesn‚Äôt have time for that‚Ä¶ but has times for others‚Ä¶ obviously the scheduling of preparing the last album overlapped with Tomorrow‚Äôs filming but like a photoshoot.. I had a bit of hope since he was at the Japan event with the members. I think he might stay in the group but we just have to wait for a subunit or next group album. i get that FNC was striking the iron while its hot with him cause the more his name is built up then after they can be more selective and have fewer higher paying solo activities. part of me is pessimistic but other part of me can see a way for him to still be involved while him and everyone else has their solo work. he did look very genuinely happy to be with the members in japan and them with him woman_shrugging_medium-light_skin_tone
------
reflectorvest: I have no expectations of them ever doing anything as 9 again. Call me pessimistic, but I‚Äôve been a fan of kpop boy groups for a long time and the odds have never been in their favor. We can reasonably assume it will be another 7 years (give or take) before they‚Äôre all finished serving in the military and that‚Äôs a really long time in this industry. Is it possible they‚Äôll go back to how it was before? Sure. Likely? Absolutely not.

Misthuio: A lot of them are doing dramas rn since so many are enlisted. Im guessing they'll continue that and probably occasionally release a mini album when required by their contract woman_shrugging_medium-dark_skin_tone

Wartonker: Do you have a link to an article talking about HSH becoming CEO again? I had no idea!
------
Misthuio: I agree. Sometimes it genuinely feels like he aint part of the group no more. I can't really watch his dramas without feeling bittersweet. I'm glad he's successful but it feels like he only occasionally joins performances as if he's going back to a high school r√©union to relive the glory days for one night persevering_face

juwaria91: I feel the same - he‚Äôs on House on wheels atm and I just can‚Äôt bring myself to watch it or any clips. All I keep thinking is all these kinda things that the rest the group did like that one on Universe where they had a vacation for the weekend and went together. He wasn‚Äôt part of that and it makes me really sad that he wasn‚Äôt. I just hope there‚Äôs nothing more to it than the fact that he wants to do his own thing and there is still a good relationship with the rest of the members - I can imagine promoting as an idol after so many injuries must be hard so it‚Äôs natural to want to act more where there isn‚Äôt as much of a strain on his body.",emotional

In August, NoiX Entertainment announced that ‚ÄúMusic Bank‚Äù would start up its world tour again after a three-year hiatus due to COVID-19. For the third time, ‚ÄúMusic Bank‚Äù was confirmed to return to Chile to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first ‚ÄúMusic Bank in Chile‚Äù back in 2012. The upcoming ‚ÄúMusic Bank in Chile‚Äù event will be held on November 12 with performers NCT DREAM, (G)I-DLE, TXT, ATEEZ, THE BOYZ, and STAYC, who will greet an audience of over 47,000 fans. On November 9, KBS shared, ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòMusic Bank‚Äô world tour that began in 2011 will hold its 15th performance in Chile this year for ‚ÄòMusic Bank in Chile.‚Äô Artist and actor [SF9‚Äôs] Rowoon has been chosen as the MC and will guide the performances.‚Äù New ‚ÄúMusic Bank‚Äù world tour MC Rowoon has gained tons of popularity through his roles in dramas like ‚ÄúExtraordinary You,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Affection,‚Äù ‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù and more. He will be receiving the ‚ÄúMC baton‚Äù from Park Bo Gum, a longtime former MC of ‚ÄúMusic Bank‚Äù and its various world tour special episodes. The producers of the ‚ÄúMusic Bank‚Äù world tour commented, ‚ÄúIt feels new for both the producers and artists that the ‚ÄòMusic Bank‚Äô world tour is continuing after three years.

Through ‚ÄòMusic Bank in Chile,‚Äô we will showcase legendary performances that capture the originality of K-pop festivals. Please look forward to it.‚Äù ‚ÄúMusic Bank in Chile‚Äù will be held on November 12 at 8 p.m. local time at the Estadio Monumental Stadium.

Besides those in the military, who will be missing at the performance? I'm guessing Rowoon, but I'm not sure about Zuho's or Chani's filming schedules. What do you think?

They were so good live and the fact that fans together could see them perform together as 5 was so amazing. I loved the candid way the members interacted with fans mid performance, ad libbed their songs and the funny interactions with the translator Lia. 

Zuho said something and when she didnt immediately translate it he looked confused and sly and repeated himself.

The lack of Chani really highlighted how different each rapper is, with Zuho trying to cover Chani's lines - he has a totally different rapping style and wouldn't have been able to practice the lines that much. 

The setlist was:
Teardrop  
Good guy  
Introduction of the members  
Scream  
Love again  
Chat with fans again and then  
Play Hard

I was even lucky enough to win a red carpet expeience and got 0.5 seconds of eye contact with Dawon. I hope we can see the whole group together as 9 in a solo concert one day.

sf9,Best members to subscribe to on the universe app,I'm a new fantasy and want to subscribe one the app. But I would like to know which members are best to subscribe too. I love all the members but my biases are Jae and Inseong. So I'd happily sub to any/ all of them. :),https://www.reddit.com/r/SF9/comments/uwmhps/best_members_to_subscribe_to_on_the_universe_app/,"liverbirds: Taeyang, Jaeyoon and Dawon are are pretty active, I would say your best bet is one of them!
------
bexter222: In all honesty, thinking about the most horrible subject there is, I wouldn't recommend subscribing to Jaeyoon right now because enlistment is happening this year. Dawon has also made some comments that make me nervous (he's my ult) and others nervous as though he might be making plans too. Taeyang is really active, Rowoon hardly posts. Chani is barely there, Hwiyoung comes and goes in bursts, bless him, you won't see him for a few weeks then you'll randonly get a smattering of messages which are usually funny and cute as heck. Zuho seems steady normally but he's now starting his stage show so he will be a lot quieter. Dawon is really funny in messages, he's also very thoughtful, sweet, gives lots of advise to K-Fantasy and in general and changes subject A LOT so you'll be on your toes if you do subscribe to him.
------
unitaya: From most to least active, in my opinion! Posts every other day: Jaeyoon, Dawon, Taeyang (Jaeyoon posts the most photos but I'd say Dawon does the most active reading and responding to fan messages? Taeyang talks at us haha) Once a week: Zuho, Hwiyoung Never/once a month if you're lucky: Chani, Rowoon Enlisted: Inseong, Youngbin
------
ConcernedUnicorn19: On bubble I had them all except chani because he didn't post. From what I could see, Dawon, Zuho, Taeyang, and Jaeyoon posted the most. Taeyang is my ult so of course I'm gonna push him but it really just depends what you like. On universe I only have Taeyang.
------
chanely-bean1123: I thought since Jae is a 1994 baby he wouldn't be going till next year? Since Inseong and youngbin have both only just gone in and they are 93 babies, or were they able to out there's off?? But I figure if I sub, I can always unsub later if I read the rules properly??
------
bexter222: There was a law passed where all 94 babies have to enlist this year so we're losing Jae too „Ö†„Ö† I'm heartbroken thinking about it already, he's my little angel loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face And you can unsubscribe that's correct, but the way you get sucked in these though..... Dawon and Jae are the Kings of the delulu makers, you will fall harder than you've ever fallen in your life, I swear. And just wait til Inseong is back out, OMG he's amazing, I can't wait til you get to talk to him when he's back smiling_face_with_tearsmiling_face_with_tear
------
chanely-bean1123: See dawon is my least favourite, like I'm sure he is an amazing guy, but he is waaaaaaaay too OTT during some things for me. Lol maybe subbing to him will change my mind?? And honestly even if I just get some of Jae, I'll be happy, he is my Ultimate ultimate bias, and so I'll take just about anything I can get, while I can get it. And I'm so sad I missed out on Inseong, but i had gotten SF9 just after he enlisted. Honestly broke my heart.
------
bexter222: I'd actually say it's possibly good you missed his enlistment, I genuinely am still heartbroken over it. I miss him so much. He was my first enlistment and the way he talks to you he makes you feel like you're talking with a friend. It's been 9 weeks and when monthly inseong came on Sunday I just cried because it felt like he'd only just gone. It feels like he's been gone for about a year and it's horrible. I didn't think I could miss someone I'll never know, yet here I am still suffering grinning_face_with_sweat Dawon is my ult actually for that reason, he's a complete mood maker when he's with the others, he wants to put a smile on people's faces and he does a lot of stuff to make people laugh. He actually is a very sweet and thoughtful guy too, though. He does a lot of vlives where he will try to help Fantasy out, he reads comments from people and tries to offer his thoughts on what he will do in their situation, tries to lift them up. In DM he sends dad jokes, asks Fantasy for advice on household things sometimes, shares his excitement over football with us, teases us, flirts with us, sends sweet random pick up messages and reminds K-Fantasy to file their taxes etc. He's definitely a lot deeper than he shows with just his crazy side. Whoever you decide to subscribe to, these men are absolute DARLINGS and prepare to fall head over heels in absolute crazy love with them.
------
lunazoomer: Dawon is my bias! I think I love him BECAUSE he is OTT! He loves the attention and making people laugh. He genuinely makes me laugh out loud a lot! He's such a beautiful soul! (Jaeyoon is my bias wrecker since I saw The Stealer performance in Kingdom ;\_\_\_\_\_;) &#x200B; But thanks for making this post! I was actually thinking the same thing as I recently downloaded Universe! I think I'm gonna subscribe to Dawon and Jaeyoon but I would feel fomo about the others >.<
------
chanely-bean1123: See that is why I have put off joining all these, I am already head over heels in love with most of them, just from what I've already experienced and watched and honestly, getting even closer, even through something like this scares me a bit. I like that I love them from a far, but would like to see the realer side of them, the one that's not in front of the cameras. But I'm hoping this will add just a bit more joy to my day, and so far from what you've said it will definitely do that. So thank you. :)
------
chanely-bean1123: Yea see I love OTT as well, but dawon was just tooooo OTT and attention seeking. Like he couldn't control himself when to stop. Buuuuut. I subbed to home on the app to give him a chance, as otherwise he would be the only 1 out of all my bias groups that piss me off, and I didn't like that. And so far it's been a real treat. He's shared his food and a couple of selfies and just generally chats. Tae and jae are the others I'm subbed to. I've just woke up to like 50 message dfpem tae, he is very active and is very sweet. And shared some dance vids the other day whilst jae is no where to be seen yet. But I highly recommend it. I wake up more happy cause of it. They are sharing just that little but extra of their lives sith us and it makes me feel really connected. I know it's a paid service, but it's still really nice to see their thoughts. The messages are fairly random, but I still love it.
------
lunazoomer: It makes me sad to see you say he pisses you off ;\_\_\_;, im pretty sure the others say he's actually the shyest in the group ;\_\_\_; but thank-you for sharing! I wanted to sub to dawon and jae but if tae is more active maybe ill choose him instead! or maybe i'll just go for all three haha! I've been debating for a long time bc i want to get bubble for skz too, its been so long that i might as well just do it already haha!
------
chanely-bean1123: I don't like it either, but I have a tolerance level for people acting out and he unfortunately goes above it sometimes. Like I love chaotic and OTT members, but he just pushes it waaaay past that and to me at that point it stops being funny. The most notable of these times is during the 'fact in star' interview. But that's why I wanted to sub to him, to see that other side of him and hopefully get past it. And so far I have loved his messages and him keeping us up to date of his life. Him and tae are the posters of the group atm. It use to include Inseong as well, but he's now in military :( So I highly recommend subbing to dawon a nd tae both. for me its been well worth it. I also have bubble for skz, and I have felix, Chanbie, lino and IN, and so far lino is the biggest poster, then the others. I love it. I am currently subbed to 14 members of my 4 fave groups. And I love every moment of it.",emotional

sf9,New SF9 Fan,I am a new SF9 fan and i am wondering why they are so underrated. i have been listening to their discography and dare i say their songs are all BOP and i actually like them more than the other groups i stan who are way more popular. Is there a reason for this- was it the timing of their debut? poor marketing and promotions- i mean they're so active giving out content etc? it just boggles my mind,https://www.reddit.com/r/SF9/comments/ubb5h2/new_sf9_fan/,"unitaya: I appreciate the sentiment but it almost feels like a backhanded compliment whenever someone talks about the ""underratedness"" of certain groups. They have a sizeable and dedicated Korean fandom and the members are all established doing their own solo schedules outside of group activities whenever possible, as I'm sure you know since you mentioned how much content they have. I can't really answer ""why"" they're underappreciated when it's just a matter of people admittedly not listening to them or liking other groups more, which is absolutely fine as we all have different tastes and priorities. I guess you could help answer your own question by asking yourself how/why you decided to stan them now :')
------
peanut_t: I wouldn't say they are underrated but maybe under appreciated. They're already a five year old group and FNC is not focusing on getting new fans but milking existing fans dry haha. Their korean fandom is also bigger than their international fandom which is why international fandom only gets the crumbs and no new fans are attracted.
------
bexter222: I've been Fantasy 8 months and I can tell you I've never seen a live OT9 vlive due to their schedules. They couldn't even get time to get together for a group vlive before Inseong enlisted and the whole fandom was crying for it. Their schedules are crazy sometimes where they might not even see each other for a long time. Speaking to long time Fantasy, N.Fia, Boice as well, FNC seem to be awful for having a pet favourite who they focus on for a while before throwing them aside for the next favourite. The current one is P1H but I'm sure if they debut another group they like more, P1H will get the same treatment. FNC also don't bother to sub content anymore when they release it to YouTube so we have to wait for translators to do it for us in their own time our of their kindness, to let us share things like their logs. Which is a shame, since Womderwall and other partner agencies are more than happy to sub their content immediately as they understand and acknowledge that there are international fans who want to see the same media as the local fans.
